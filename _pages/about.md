Hi! I am a PhD candidate at Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg. My work centres on __robust machine learning models__ for time-series data from __cyber-physical systems__. I study how models generalise under distribution shift, withstand sensor noise or faults and how rigorous benchmarks can reveal these weaknesses.

Beyond research, I help draft an AI-Act-aligned __standard for reliable ML__ within a VDI/VDE working group, aiming to turn academic findings into clear industrial guidelines.

Ultimately, I want these insights to power __safe AI__ solutions in manufacturing, maritime operations and energy systems. If you're interested in collaborating, have questions, or simply want to chat about trustworthy AI, I'd love to connect!
